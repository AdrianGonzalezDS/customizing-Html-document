R Markdown
==========

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Plot of the cars Dataset

``` r
plot(cars)
```

Including Plots
===============

You can also embed plots, for example:

### Plot of the Presure Dataset

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
